# About FoundSound

The FoundSound app gives artists, event organisers and audience members the ability to interact with one another in a way that hasn't been done before!

FoundSound gives artists the ability to respond to ads posted by event organisers.

Event organisers can post ads where artists can respond to get them to play a gig at their event.
